<blog-post id="assignment-1-3" title="A software solution to keep my TODO list accessible across all my devices" date="04/27/2014"><p>There is always a lot of stuff I want to accomplish during the day, unfortunately I don't like writing them manually to my notebook. In the evening when the day is over I like to sit down and think about what I have accomplished today, and what I need to do tomorrow. And since I hate typing on my phone, but love reading from its screen, I wan't to have a solution that will allow me create my tasks on my computer and will synchronize them with my phone.</p><p>I am a programmer, so I have necessary skillset to create a solution like this. The product itself is very narrow scoped so I think it is very realistic to create a solution like this in 8 weeks.</p></blog-post>
