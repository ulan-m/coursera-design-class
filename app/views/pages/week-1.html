    <p>The first moment I saw this device - I fell in love with it! Now I can carry my whole library in my pocket. I can keep reading in any conditions: bright sunlight, artificial room light, even with no light at all. The thing I like about Kindle the most is the quality of text: it is the same as on a printed book, maybe even better. And also the battery: it can last for more than a month!</p>

        I have created a simple mock up of a page for today's todo list. The prototype is accessible <a href="https://www.fluidui.com/editor/live/preview/p_mFvTg7Mnv72xOrqhR8F6uXJxKVPbyU4M.1398594530080">here</a>. The prototype currently has only one page, and of course the final product will have a lot more.
